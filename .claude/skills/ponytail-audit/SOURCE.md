Copied from the MIT-licensed ponytail plugin. Not imported with `just add_skill`
because the plugin is a multi-harness tree, not a skills.sh package.

## Adaptations from upstream

1. **First-party** — `SOURCE.md` and `evals/` are loadout-repo owned and must
   survive a bump.
2. **Upstream-verbatim** — `SKILL.md` is copied from upstream unless a later
   adaptation is listed.
